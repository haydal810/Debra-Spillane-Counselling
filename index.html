				<img src="images\debs_3.jpg" alt="Debra Hayden" />
				<p>Debra Hayden provides professional Counselling & Psychotherapy services in Killarney, County Kerry.
				</p>
				<p>Debra has always had a great interest in people and began her studies in 2004, studying a BA Degree
					in Social Science in University College Cork. Having completed her degree in 2007, Debra moved
					overseas and travelled extensively, gaining a wealth of knowledge through friendships formed and a
					variety of cultures experienced.</p>
				<p>While in Melbourne, Australia, Debra worked as part of a well-being team, in a prominant all girls
					secondary school and became aware of the need of well-being support for individuals who ae
					experiencing challenges in their own personal lives. To learn more about how she could best support
					the students, Debra completed a certificate in Adolescent Counselling, through Monash University in
					2014. Having become more aware, and noticing the positive effect Counselling was having on students,
					Debra decided to complete a BA (Honours) Degree in Counselling & Psychotherapy. She made the move
					home to Ireland, to begin her studies in the Cork Institute of Technology, where she completed her
					studies in 2019.</p>

			<!-- What is Counselling? -->
			<article id="what_is">
				<h3 class="major">What is Counselling?</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images\man.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Counselling is a form of talk-therapy. It is a co-created space between therapist and client, which
					aids in the client becoming more self aware and having time to think and feel, with more clarity and
					understanding about who they are and the life they have lived so far.</p>
				<p>Counselling allows people the space to talk about difficult problems or feelings they experience in a
					safe, confidential environment.</p>
				<p>A counsellor is not there to tell you what is best for you. You are the only person who truly knows
					your own story. Instead, a counsellor will encourage you to talk about what is bothering you, and
					help you understand and identify a way for you to move forward and reconcile with your own issues or
					help you look at these issues through a new lens and explore different ways of coping.</p>

				<h3 class="major">How I can help you</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images\2peopletalk.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>When you initially make contact with the service, we will organise a meeting at a date and time that
					suits you. This appointment is an initial assessment; this allows time for relevant details to be
					gathered and to see if I am the right fit for you and the issues which you would like to focus on.
				</p>
				<p>I work with adults over 18 in an integrative, holistic way. I draw from a range of theories such as
					Gestalt Therapy, Internal Family Systems (ISF), Attachment Theory, Person Centred Therapy and
					Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) depending on the person and the type of issue they are
					presenting with. At all times, the client is central to the work.</p>
				<p>There are a number of issues that a client might seek support for. Some issues include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Anxiety</li>
					<li>Bereavement</li>
					<li>Bullying</li>
					<li>Depression</li>
					<li>Eating disorders</li>
					<li>Issues related to the family unit</li>
					<li>Grief</li>
					<li>Loss</li>
					<li>Sexuality & Sexual Identity</li>
					<li>Stress</li>
					<li>Suicide or Self-Harm</li>
					<li>Working with victims of abuse</li>
					<li>Work related issues</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you are unsure if Counselling is for you, I would encourage you to make contact and I will be
					happy to answer any questions you may have. Sometimes speaking to family or friends just isn’t
					enough support to hold you and so having a space to come to, with a professional therapist who
					provides a safe and confidential environment, may be exactly what you need. </p>
